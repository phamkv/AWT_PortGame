# AWT PortGame

This is the code repository for the Unity to Godot porting project as part of the university lecture _Project Advanced Web Technologies_.

A prototype open world game was developed in Unity and then ported to Godot demonstrating the capabilities and challenges of the Godot Engine and Godot Editor. The project was maintained from November 2023 until March 2024 and uses Unity 2022 and Godot 4.2.

The repository contains both the project files for Godot and Unity. See further documentation for installation and usage inside the respective folder.

## Authors

The project was developed by Cornelius Conrad, Fabian Kre√üin, and Kevin Pham.
